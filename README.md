nussl
=====

**The Northwestern University Source Separation Library (nussl)** (pronounced ["nuzzle"](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nuzzle)) is a flexible, object oriented python
audio source separation library created by the [Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.cs.northwestern.edu/)
at Northwestern University. At its core, nussl provides implementations of common source separation
algorithms as well as an easy-to-use framework for prototyping and adding new algorithms. The aim of nussl is
to create a low barrier to entry for using popular source separation algorithms, while also allowing the
user fine tuned control of low-level parameters.


**NOTICE: nussl is currently in alpha. Please be mindful.**

Please see the issues page before contacting the authors.

Branch Layout
-------------

- **Master** contains the most recent stable version, the version that you get when you pip install *nussl*.
- **Development** contains the most recent work, but is not as stable as master. Most all of development work happens
in this branch before being pushed to **master**.
- **Experimental** has many more implementations, but many have not been vetted or properly tested. Some methods in this
branch require extra functionality that cannot be included in a pip install, such as the Vamp binary files or
tensorflow. This branch is the bleeding edge.
- **gh-pages** is used to auto generate our documentation using Sphinx.
- Other feature branches do exist from time to time as well.



Documentation
-------------

Full documentation is [available here.](https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/nussl/)

Note: This package has been tested with python 2.7, but not python 3.x yet. Use python 3 at your own peril!


Features
--------

At its core, nussl contains implementations of the following source separation algorithms:

Spatialization algorithms:
* Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique (DUET)
* PROJET

Median filtering algorithms:
* REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET)
* REPET using the cosine similarity matrix (REPET-SIM)
* Harmonic/Percussive Source Separation (HPSS)
* Kernel Adaptive Modeling (KAM)

General matrix decomposition:
* Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)
* Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Other Separation Methods
* Ideal Mask
* Overlap Add
* Algorithm Picker (multicue separation)
* Separation via 2DFT
* Melody Tracking separation (Melodia)

Also coming: Deep methods (Deep Clustering, Huang et. al. Deep Separation, etc.) (with keras backend), Separation by
Segmentation, Melody tracking methods (Melodia, SIMM), and many more! Note: newly algorithms usually do not live in the master branch.

The nussl also has an evaluation framework, which provides interoperability
between nussl and [mir_eval](https://github.com/craffel/mir_eval) (a python implementation of [BSSEval](http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/bss_eval)) as well as implementations of other evaluation methods.


Installation
------------

1. Install anaconda2

2. Create env
```bash
conda create --name nussl_env python=2.7 numpy scipy matplotlib
```

3. Activate env
```bash
source activate nussl_env
```

4. Install nussl from source to /anaconda2/lib/site-packages

A note on cloning from github: **nussl** contains a large number of uncompressed audio benchmark files for testing which makes cloning directly from Github a slow process. **nussl** is now synced with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com), so if you want to clone from Github without downloading the large testing files, please use Git LFS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/interactiveaudiolab/nussl.git
python setup.py install
```

5. Verfiy install in python
```bash
python
```
```python
import nussl
nussl.version
```


Development Status
------------------

Camera ready (in master and pip builds):
* Repet
* RepetSim
* IdealMask
* OverlapAdd
* DUET
* NMF
* RPCA
* PROJET
* 2DFT separation
* Deep clustering
* HPSS

Planned:
* KAM
* SIMM
* Separation via segmentation
* Your algorithm? (contact us for details)
